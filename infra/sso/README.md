# AWS SSO Management Setup

This directory contains Terraform configuration for AWS SSO/IAM Identity Center management with automated user group creation.

## Features

- **Automated Group Creation**: Creates user groups in AWS Identity Store
- **Permission Sets**: Pre-configured IAM permission sets for different roles
- **Account Assignments**: Automatic assignment of permissions to groups across accounts
- **Multi-Account Support**: Works with AWS Organizations member accounts

## User Groups Created

The following user groups are automatically created:

- **InfrastructureTeam**: Infrastructure management and deployment access
- **DevelopmentTeam**: Application development and deployment access
- **ProductionTeam**: Production environment management and operations
- **Auditors**: Read-only access for auditing and compliance

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the SSO configuration, you need to set up AWS credentials and permissions:

### 1. AWS Organization Setup

**First, set up your AWS Organization and accounts:**

- ðŸ“– **Complete Guide**: [`ORGANIZATION_SETUP.md`](ORGANIZATION_SETUP.md)
- This will convert your existing AWS account into a management account
- Create development and production member accounts
- Get all the account IDs you'll need

### 2. GitHub OIDC Setup

**Then configure GitHub Actions authentication:**

- ðŸ“– **Detailed Guide**: [`AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- Set up GitHub OIDC provider in AWS
- Create IAM role for GitHub Actions
- Configure repository secrets

### 3. Required Variables and Secrets

Add the following to your GitHub repository (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables):

**Variables** (visible in logs):

- `MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your AWS management account ID (12-digit number)

**Secrets** (hidden from logs):

- `DEVELOPMENT_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your development account ID (if different)
- `PRODUCTION_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your production account ID (if different)

### 4. Troubleshooting Hanging Workflows

If your workflow hangs at "Assuming role with OIDC":

1. **Check Repository Secrets**: Ensure `MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID` is set correctly
2. **Verify IAM Role**: Confirm the `GitHubActionsSSORole` exists with correct trust policy
3. **OIDC Provider**: Ensure GitHub OIDC provider is configured in AWS
4. **Permissions**: Verify the role has necessary permissions for SSO operations

See [`AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

## Setup Process

1. **Create AWS Organization** (if not already done):

   ```bash
   # In your management account
   aws organizations create-organization
   ```

2. **Create Member Accounts**:

   ```bash
   # Create development account
   aws organizations create-account \
     --email dev@magebase.dev \
     --account-name "Magebase Development"

   # Create production account
   aws organizations create-account \
     --email prod@magebase.dev \
     --account-name "Magebase Production"
   ```

3. **Configure Terraform Variables**:
   Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your account IDs:

   ```hcl
   development_account_id = "123456789012"
   production_account_id  = "987654321098"
   ```

4. **Deploy SSO Configuration**:

   ```bash
   cd infra/sso
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Permission Sets

This configuration creates the following permission sets:

- **AdministratorAccess**: Full administrative access
- **InfrastructureManager**: Infrastructure deployment and management
- **ApplicationDeployment**: Application deployment and container management
- **SESManagement**: Amazon SES management and email sending
- **ReadOnlyAccess**: Read-only access for auditing

## Account Assignments

The configuration assigns permissions as follows:

### Management Account

- Administrator: `admin@magebase.dev` (user)
- Infrastructure: `InfrastructureTeam` (group)

### Development Account

- Infrastructure: `InfrastructureTeam` (group)
- Deployment: `DevelopmentTeam` (group)
- SES: `ses-service@magebase.dev` (user)

### Production Account

- Infrastructure: `InfrastructureTeam` (group)
- Deployment: `ProductionTeam` (group)
- Read-only: `Auditors` (group)

## Security Considerations

- The SSO instance is created in the management account
- Permission sets follow the principle of least privilege
- All resources are tagged for proper resource management
- GitHub Actions uses OIDC for secure authentication

## Troubleshooting

### User ID Placeholders

If you see errors related to `USER_ID_PLACEHOLDER_*`, you need to:

1. Create the users in AWS SSO console
2. Get their user IDs from the console
3. Update the Terraform configuration with actual user IDs
4. Re-run `terraform apply`

### Group Creation Issues

If groups fail to create, ensure:

- AWS SSO is properly enabled in your management account
- You have the necessary permissions to create Identity Store resources
- The identity store ID is correctly retrieved

## Next Steps

1. Configure your identity source (Active Directory, external IdP, or AWS SSO users)
2. Create users and assign them to groups
3. Test access to member accounts
4. Set up automated user provisioning with SCIM
5. Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA)
